Handle all your tasks with Ponfi - your new refurbished Task Management System.

## Setup

Clone this repository and install all the dependencies with `npm`:

npm install
```

Create a file named `.env`, this will have two environment variables - PORT and MONGO_URI.

## Run development server

You can run the server in two ways. With the `start` script, the server won't reflect any changes made to file; while the `dev` script will.
```bash
npm run dev
```
